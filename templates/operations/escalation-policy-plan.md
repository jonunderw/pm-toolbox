## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
| Level | Definition | Examples | Response Time | Escalation Time |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Complete service outage, data loss, security breach | Website down, payment system failure, data breach | 0-15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **P1 - High** | Major functionality impacted, significant user impact | Core feature broken, performance degradation >50% | 15-30 minutes | 1 hour |
| **P2 - Medium** | Moderate impact, workaround available | Non-critical feature broken, minor performance issues | 30 minutes - 2 hours | 4 hours |
| **P3 - Low** | Minor impact, cosmetic issues | UI glitches, documentation errors | 2-8 hours | 24 hours |

### Impact Assessment
- **Critical**: >75% of users affected
- **High**: 25-75% of users affected  
- **Medium**: 5-25% of users affected

## Escalation Procedures

### Automatic Escalation Triggers
- **Time-based**: No acknowledgment within defined timeframe
- **Severity-based**: P0/P1 incidents auto-escalate to management
- **Impact-based**: Customer-facing issues auto-escalate
- **Resolution delays**: Incidents exceeding SLA targets

### Manual Escalation Triggers
- Technical expertise needed beyond current responder
- Resource authorization required (budget, personnel)
- Customer communication needed at executive level
- Media attention or regulatory implications
- Legal or compliance issues

### Communication Requirements
#### P0 - Critical Incidents
- **Immediate**: On-call engineer + Team lead
- **15 minutes**: Engineering manager + key stakeholders
- **30 minutes**: Director + customer success (if customer-facing)
- **1 hour**: Executive team + legal (if applicable)

#### P1 - High Incidents  
- **30 minutes**: Team lead + relevant stakeholders
- **1 hour**: Engineering manager
- **2 hours**: Director (if unresolved)

## Stakeholder Communication

### Internal Stakeholders
| Stakeholder | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | Preferred Method |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|------------------|
| Engineering Team | Immediate | 30 min | 1 hour | 4 hours | Slack + Email |
| Product Team | 15 min | 1 hour | 2 hours | 8 hours | Slack + Email |
| Customer Success | 15 min | 1 hour | 4 hours | 24 hours | Email + Phone |
| Executive Team | 30 min | 2 hours | 8 hours | N/A | Phone + Email |
| Legal/Compliance | As needed | As needed | As needed | N/A | Phone + Email |

### External Communication
#### Customer Communication
- **P0**: Status page update within 15 minutes
- **P1**: Status page update within 1 hour
- **P2**: Email notification within 4 hours (if customer-facing)
- **P3**: No external communication unless requested

#### Vendor/Partner Notification
- **When to notify**: If vendor systems are impacted or needed for resolution
- **How to notify**: Dedicated support channels, escalation contacts
- **Information to provide**: Impact description, expected resolution time

## Decision Authority Matrix

### Resolution Decisions
| Decision Type | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|---------------|----|----|----|----|
| Rollback deployment | On-call engineer | On-call engineer | Team lead | Team lead |
| Emergency hotfix | Team lead | Team lead | Engineering manager | Engineering manager |
| Service shutdown | Engineering manager | Engineering manager | Engineering manager | Director |
| Customer compensation | Director | Director | Director | Director |
| Public statement | CTO | CTO | Director | Engineering manager |

### Resource Authorization
| Resource Need | Authorization Required | Escalation Path |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Contractor/consultant | Engineering manager | Director → CTO |
| Cloud resources ($1K+) | Engineering manager | Director → CTO |
| External services | Director | CTO |
| Legal consultation | Director | CTO |
| PR/Communications | CTO | CEO |

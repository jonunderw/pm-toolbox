- **Peer Review** - Code review phase
- **Completed** - Development complete
- **Delivered** - Ready for testing
- **Acceptance Testing** - QA testing phase
- **Staging** - Deployed to staging environment

## Estimation Guidelines
- **Fibonacci Scale**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
- **1 Point**: Simple changes, minimal effort
- **2-3 Points**: Small features, well-understood work
- **5-8 Points**: Medium complexity, some unknowns
- **13+ Points**: Complex work, should be broken down

---

## Notes & Best Practices

- **Clarity**: Needs to be clear for engineers and QA
- **Completeness**: Should have no questions when reading  
- **Testable**: Should generate 1 or more test cases from the story
  - **Assertions**: Acceptance criteria should be testable assertions
  - **Positive**: Happy path test cases
  - **Negative**: Error handling/error state test cases
  - **Boundaries**: Edge cases and boundary conditions
- **Sprintable**: Should fit within a single sprint
